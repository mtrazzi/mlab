My own implementations for the [MLAB]([url](https://github.com/crsegerie/mlab2)https://github.com/crsegerie/mlab2) project-based course, where (among other things) you re-implement transformer-based models from scratch.

See [week 2 day 1](https://github.com/mtrazzi/mlab/blob/main/w2d1.py) for BERT and [week 2 day 3](https://github.com/mtrazzi/mlab/blob/main/w2d3_part1.py) for GPT.
